##Teams & Alliances
- The max team size is 4. There is no limit to how many teams may ally with one another.
- Withing each base/compount may only exist 1 team (we count by beds).

##No KOS (Kill on Sight)
KOS is only allowed in selected PvP zones

##PvP / KOS Zones
Airdrops    | Quarries (All) 
Airfield    | Satellite 
Cargo Ship  | Sewer Branch 
Excavator   | Train Yard
Harbors     | Water Treatment
Launch Site | Attack Helicopter
Military Tunnels | Crash sites
Oil Rig	    | Locked Crates
Power Plant	| Raids / Counter raids 
- In the event of a crate or box, the PvP ends as soon as its contents have been collected and the person has left the area (1 square surriounding airdrop in all directions).
- An easy way to tell if the crate has been collected is to open the map (press G) and check if the icon is still there. 
- PvP for Attack Helicopter crates stops when the explosion marker has disappear on the map.
- Puzzle monuments: KOS areas include any square that has part of the monument in it.
- Quarries: KOS area is only inside the quarry, not the whole square.
##Raids
__DOs
- If you are online raiding, you can kill the occupants of the base.
- Occupants of the base can also kill you.
- Anyone can come and counter raid you and steal your supplies.
- You can be attacked while in the raided base, while trying to leave the raided base, or immediate area with the loot. 
- People can camp outside and follow you back to your base. You are not safe until you are inside your own base.
__DON'Ts
- Do not raid within the first 24 hours of the wipe.
- Do not raid noob bases, if it is still thatch/twig leave it alone. If someone has a starter base and did not lock their doors leave them alone or inform them in chat.
- Helis are NOT raid material, do not use them to crash into a player's base.
- Do not lure attack heli in to destroy another player's base.
- Locking players out of their base once the raid is over. If you pur down doors/locks, leave a note with the new code OR remove the locks/leave unlocked. *** This includes stealing bases***
- Locking the TC. If you place a new TC it must be unlocked. Do not wall off TC
- Foundation wiping
- Walling off player's bags or leaving your own placed bag in the raided base.
- No door camping with no raiding supplies; you are not daiding, you are just being a jerk. 
- No trap bases (fake bases you are not living in, made to lure/kill other players). You may have traps in your own base! As long as it's within base walls(high external walls it is fine.
##SAMS Sites
All SAMS Sites must be labeled on the map with a vending machine. Ex: SAMS Site! No Fly Zone!
##Be respectful! This is a NOOB server.
- Have respect for all players, if you are being toxic and we have proof you will be muted, kicked, or banned.
- Do not place any traps/land mines out in the open. All things that can hurt/kill have to be within your own high walls/base.
##Stealing
- If someone catches you stealing THEIR things they are allowed to kill you. This can include furnance materials, helis, horses, cars (keep them locked!) or things out of a recycler they're using.
- If you walk into someone's base or compount uninvited they CAN kill you.
**ONLY Admins can speak with authority, do not make claims for admins based on that authority. Basically, do not speak for us, we will make the decisions on actions needed to be taken. We understand this is Rust but it is a learning/chill server. BE NICE sometimes!
